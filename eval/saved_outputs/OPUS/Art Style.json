While it shares some subject matter similarities with the first image, such as a building and trees, the painting technique is quite different. The brushstrokes are finer and less visible, and there is more emphasis on depicting textures and small details realistically.

The rocky cliffs are painted with careful attention to the play of light and shadow to create a sense of three-dimensional form and texture. The color palette is more muted and naturalistic.\n\nSo in summary, while the second painting uses an impressionistic style, the first and third paintings both employ a more realistic, finely detailed approach to representing their subjects.

This naturalistic approach focused on accurately representing the subject is characteristic of Realism.\n\nThe second painting is a seascape that also exhibits qualities of Realism. The cliffs, ocean waves, and sky are painted with great detail to depict the scene as true-to-life as possible. The artist has used subtle color gradations and precise brushwork to create a convincing illusion of the coastal landscape.\n\nIn contrast, the third painting takes a much more expressive and abstracted approach. While it does portray a human face, the features are distorted and exaggerated with bold colors and rough brushstrokes. The yellow hair and green bow introduce an unnatural color palette. This style is more in line with Expressionism, which prioritizes conveying emotion and the artist's subjective perspective over realistic representation.\n\nTherefore, given the naturalistic rendering and emphasis on accurately capturing the subject matter, I believe the first and second paintings are more closely aligned in their Realist style, while the third represents a different Expressionist aesthetic.

The loose handling of paint and focus on the workers' hunched postures and shadowed faces align with Expressionist techniques of prioritizing the artist's subjective perspective and evoking an emotional response in the viewer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) the third image shares the same art style as the reference image.",

The limited color palette of browns, reds and whites also contributes to the modernist, avant-garde feel.\n\nThe second image is a loose, gestural sketch rendered in black ink or charcoal. While it also reduces the forms to simplified shapes, the style is more about quick, expressive linework rather than the constructed, faceted planes seen in the first image.\n\nHowever, the third painting shares several key characteristics with the reference image. It employs a similar splintering and fracturing of the pictorial space into abstracted, geometric segments. The boats and their reflections are depicted through angled shapes and planes that break up and reshape the forms, much like the treatment of the figure in the first painting. The third image also makes use of a muted, limited color palette that is tonally similar to the browns and reds of the reference.\n\nSo in summary, while all three images utilize abstraction and simplification of forms to varying degrees, the third painting (B) most closely emulates the distinctive cubist-inspired style and fragmented visual language of the first reference image.

This Cubist approach to breaking down and reconstructing the subject matter is characteristic of artists like Picasso and Braque in the early 20th century.\n\nThe second painting, in contrast, depicts a more naturalistic landscape scene. While the brushwork is loose and expressive, the trees, cottage, river and figures are still recognizable without the fragmentation seen in the first image. This painting seems more in line with Post-Impressionist or Fauvist styles.\n\nHowever, the third painting once again employs a Cubist vocabulary similar to the first image. The buildings are reduced to overlapping geometric shapes, with multiple perspectives presented simultaneously. Depth and volume are flattened. The limited earth-toned palette also parallels the first painting.\n\nSo in summary, while all three display modernist techniques, the first and third paintings both exemplify the signature splintered forms and shallow space of Cubism, making the third image the closest match to the reference.

The palette emphasizes warm yellows, oranges and earth tones.\n\nThe second image portrays a woman in a pink blouse, but the style is quite different. The painting technique is smoother and more blended, without the same visible, energetic brushstrokes. The colors are softer and hazier overall. While still painterly, the approach seems to align more with a softer realism than Impressionism.\n\nIn contrast, the third image of a woman at a washbasin demonstrates the hallmarks of Impressionism seen in the first painting. The brushwork is sketchy and broken, with distinct strokes of color side-by-side. Warm colors dominate, applied with spontaneous, flickering touches. The emphasis is on capturing an impression of light and a fleeting moment.\n\nSo in summary, while all three works depict solitary female figures, the first and third paintings appear to be done in a classic Impressionist manner, while the second has a notably different, more smoothly realistic style.

The painting has a dark, moody atmosphere with heavy shading and contrast between light and shadow. The brushwork appears loose and expressive rather than highly detailed or precise. This style aligns closely with Realism, which aims to depict subjects truthfully without idealization.\n\nThe third image also portrays a lush, shadowy forest interior. The colors are rich and earthy, with dappled sunlight filtering through the dense foliage. Like the first painting, it has an immersive, naturalistic quality achieved through textured, gestural brushstrokes. This shares the Realist approach of the reference image.\n\nIn contrast, the second painting of figures by a pond has a brighter, more idyllic feeling. The colors are lighter and the brushwork appears smoother and more blended compared to the dramatic chiaroscuro of the forest scenes. The second work seems more aligned with Impressionism in its emphasis on light and looser painting style.\n\nTherefore, while all three are accomplished landscape paintings, I assess image (B), the third work, as sharing the same Realist style and aesthetic as the first reference image.
