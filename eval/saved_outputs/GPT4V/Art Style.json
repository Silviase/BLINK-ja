Realism is an art movement that began in France in the 1850s, after the 1848 Revolution. Realists rejected Romanticism, which had dominated French literature and art since the late 18th century.

Instead, it sought to portray real and typical contemporary people and situations with truth and accuracy, and not avoiding unpleasant or sordid aspects of life.\n\nThe second image also shows a realistic portrayal of a scene with people interacting in a social setting. The brushwork is looser than what you might find in a classical Realist painting, which is indicative of Impressionism. Impressionism is a 19th-century art movement characterized by relatively small, thin, yet visible brush strokes, open composition, emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities (often accentuating the effects of the passage of time), ordinary subject matter, inclusion of movement as a crucial element of human perception and experience, and unusual visual angles. The style of the second image aligns more closely with Impressionism than Realism, but it is the closest match to the reference image when compared to the third image.\n\nThe third image, on the other hand, is abstract and does not provide a clear, lifelike representation of its subjects.

The second image also exhibits characteristics of realism, with a naturalistic depiction of a landscape and cattle under the moonlight, capturing the scene with a sense of accuracy and attention to detail.\n\nThe third image, on the other hand, is more aligned with Impressionism.

Realism is an art movement that began in France in the 1850s, after the 1848 Revolution, with artists such as Gustave Courbet. It aims to depict subjects as they appear in everyday life, without embellishment or interpretation.\n\nThe second image does not share the same style as the reference image. It has a surreal quality to it, with a dream-like or fantastical atmosphere, which is not characteristic of Realism. This style is more in line with Surrealism, which developed in the early 20th century and is known for its visual depictions of the unconscious mind.\n\nThe third image also does not share the same style as the reference image. It has a more abstract and expressive quality, with bold colors and brushstrokes that convey emotion rather than a realistic depiction of the scene. This style is closer to Expressionism, which emerged in the early 20th century and is characterized by the use of distortion and exaggeration for emotional effect.\n\nTherefore, neither the second nor the third image shares the same style as the reference image.

This style is closely aligned with Impressionism, which is characterized by an emphasis on the depiction of light and its changing qualities, ordinary subject matter, and inclusion of movement as a crucial element of human perception and experience.\n\nThe second image shows a landscape with a reflective body of water and trees, also painted with a focus on light and color but with a more serene and detailed approach. While it shares some qualities with Impressionism, such as the depiction of natural light and reflections, it appears to be more detailed and less focused on the fleeting effects of light and movement.\n\nThe third image is an abstract composition with geometric shapes and fragmented forms. This style is indicative of Cubism, which is characterized by an abstracted form of representation that breaks down objects into geometric shapes and often depicts them from multiple viewpoints simultaneously.\n\nBased on these observations, neither the second nor the third image shares the exact same style as the reference image. However, if we must choose the one that is closer in style to the reference image, it would be:\n\n(A) the second image\n\nThe second image is closer to Impressionism than the third image, which is Cubist.
