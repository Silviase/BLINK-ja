Point A is on the floor, which appears to be a light-colored tile, and point B is on a chair, which seems to be a dark leather material. Based on the surface colors without considering the lighting effects, point B (on the chair) has a darker surface color than point A (on the floor).

Point A is on the sponge on the edge of the sink, and point B is on the wooden cabinet door below the countertop.\n\nIt's important to note that the perceived color can be influenced by lighting and shadows, but you're asking about the surface color (albedo) without the effect of shading. The sponge at point A appears to be a yellow-green, which is generally a lighter color. The wood at point B appears to be a medium brown, which is typically darker than yellow-green.\n\nBased on the surface colors without considering shading:\n\n(B) B is darker",

However, without the ability to analyze the specific color values at these points, I can only provide a subjective assessment based on the visual appearance in the image.\n\nPoint A is on the carpet, and point B is on the leg of a person sitting on the couch. The carpet where point A is located appears to have a pattern with varying colors, including dark and light areas. The area around point A seems to be a lighter part of the pattern. Point B, on the other hand, is on a surface that appears to be consistently shaded and might be a part of clothing, which seems to be of a darker color than the lighter parts of the carpet.\n\nBased on this visual assessment, it appears that:\n(B) B is darker\n\nHowever, please note that this is a subjective evaluation and the actual albedo could be different if measured with precise instruments.",

Point A is on a darker area, which appears to be a shadowed part of a brown leather sofa, while point B is on a lighter area, which seems to be a white wall. Considering the albedo, or the intrinsic color without the effect of shading, it is likely that the surface at point B is inherently lighter in color than the surface at point A.
