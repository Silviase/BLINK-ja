IoU is a measure of the overlap between two bounding boxes, and a lower IoU value indicates a more accurate localization. In this case, the IoU value for box B is 0.82, while the IoU value for box A is 0.57. Therefore, box B more accurately localizes the object than box A.\n\n\nSo, the correct answer is (B).",
