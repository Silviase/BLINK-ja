            "full_prediction": "The first image is painted in a style that closely resembles Realism, characterized by its detailed and accurate depiction of ordinary scenes and figures. The second image also exhibits characteristics of Realism, with a detailed and naturalistic portrayal of a figure, including attention to lighting and texture.\n\nThe third image, on the other hand, has a looser, more brushy style that is more indicative of Impressionism. This style is characterized by an emphasis on the general impression of a scene, often with visible brush strokes and a lighter palette that captures the effects of light.\n\nBased on these observations, the second image shares the same style as the reference image, which is Realism.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n(A) the second image",
