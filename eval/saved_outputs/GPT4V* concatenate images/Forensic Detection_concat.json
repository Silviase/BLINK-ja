The colors and lighting seem natural, and the image has a candid quality to it.\n\n(C) The third image features a train on a curved track with vibrant yellow flowers in the foreground.

The lighting, shadows, and details appear consistent with a typical airport scene.\n- The first three images depict a fighter jet in various positions on an airstrip. However, upon closer inspection, these images have certain qualities that suggest they might not be real.

The lighting and shadows appear consistent, and there are no obvious signs of manipulation.\n\n(B) The second image has the cat sitting on a blue fabric, with a fence and vegetation in the background.
